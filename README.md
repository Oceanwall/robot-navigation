# robot-navigation
Using Web Data to Provide Robot Navigation for GDC Event Attendees

Current status:
* Visual interface complete.
* Advanced routing is complete.
* Loading Screen control is complete
* NGROK IS NOT NECESSARY; DIRECTLY ACCESS IP_V4 (and it works with phone as well)

Current TODOs:
* Update fake 3rd floor events as necessary (indices, dates, etc)
* Subscriber to change views (Indicate when robot has arrived)

Future TODOs:
* Prevent others from calling robot when robot is currently in use?
* After robot arrives, automatically redirect (?) on app.js
* USE SUBSCRIBER NODE TO NOTIFY USER WHEN ROBOT HAS ARRIVED
* Make prettier alerts
