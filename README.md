# robot-navigation
Using Web Data to Provide Robot Navigation for GDC Event Attendees

Current status:
* Visual interface complete.
* Basic routing is complete.

Current TODOs:
* For eventSelector and requestRobot, provide indication that request was successful, provide choice of doors?
* Feed in fake 3rd floor events for demo? (using app.js)

Future TODOs:
* Prevent others from calling robot when robot is currently in use?
* Create alert of some type here to let user know that a request was successfully sent (on both pages?)
* ^Make sure that input is not longer editable
* After robot arrives, automatically redirect (?) on app.js
