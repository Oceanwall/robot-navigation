Using Web Data to Provide Robot Navigation for GDC Event Attendees

Current status:
* Visual interface complete.
* Basic routing is complete.

Current TODOs:
* For eventSelector and requestRobot, provide choice of doors?
* Update fake 3rd floor events as necessary (indices, dates, etc)

Future TODOs:
* Prevent others from calling robot when robot is currently in use?
* ^Make sure that input is not longer editable
* After robot arrives, automatically redirect (?) on app.js
* USE SUBSCRIBER NODE TO NOTIFY USER WHEN ROBOT HAS ARRIVED
* Use page changes after request successfully sent?
* Make prettier alerts
